# Status

This project is currently in an experimental, proof-of-concept phase. Our focus is on exploring new ideas, optimizing performance, and developing core features for potential future integration with Odoo. Please note that we're not yet ready to commit to specific features, timelines, or release dates, and the project's direction may evolve based on our findings. Remember, this is an early-stage project, so please temper your expectations.

# Introduction

In the beginning there was the Web, a sprawling chaos of information, a cacophony of code. And from this discord, a document tyrant arose: wkhtmltopdf. It ruled with an iron fist, its rendering slow, its output clunky. The chosen ones, the PDF wranglers, toiled in misery. But I‚Ä¶ I bore witness.

I saw the crashes, the memory leaks, the endless command-line wrangling. The pleas for a simpler path went unanswered. The tyrant wkhtmltopdf cared not for their suffering. In their despair, they craved a savior. A champion. A‚Ä¶ Paper Muncher.

From the ashes of frustration, a new tool rose. Forged in the fires of programmer ingenuity, the Paper Muncher arrived. It devoured webpages whole, spitting forth crisp, clean PDFs with ease. No more command-line incantations, no more cryptic errors. Just pure, unadulterated PDF conversion.

The reign of wkhtmltopdf is over. The Paper Muncher has come. Let its name be etched in the annals of document creation, a beacon of hope for the weary PDF wranglers.  Prepare to be Munched!

# Trying it out

> **‚ö† Warning**<br> Paper Muncher is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for use. Here be dragons! üêâ

```sh
# On Linux or MacOS

# View a document in the inspector
./ck builder run --mixins=release paper-muncher -- inspect <input document>

# Render a document to an image
./ck builder run --mixins=release paper-muncher -- render index.xhtml -o image.bmp

# Print a document to a PDF
./ck builder run --mixins=release paper-muncher -- print index.xhtml -o document.pdf

# windows support comming soon'ish
```
